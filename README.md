# Bank_Account
This is a simple program to demonstrate object-oriented programming in Python

The program begins with a class

#Bank Account Class

 - Defined attributed: self, full_name, account_number, routing_number, balance
 - These attributes were then defined and developed into different methods, each with a unique function
 
#Deposit
  - In the deposit method, it takes in the parameter amount and adds it to the current balance
  
#Withdraw 
  - in the withdraw method, it uses an if statement to determine if the balance is above or below the amount, and therefore subtractable 
    without displaying a negative value
    
#Get Balance 
 - This is a method used to simply display the current balance
 
#Add Interest
 - This method is used simply to calculate interest and add to the balance 
 
#Print Receipt
 - This method was used to print the total attributed under the Bank Account class, and includes a line of code found on line 44 modified from Stack Overflow
   to display the account number with only the last four digits visible as numbers, and the first four digits displayed as stars.
